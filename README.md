# Meso_acoustics
Examining the effects of the 2015-2016 marine heatwave on mesopelagic fishes in the CCE

This project was created by Ily Iglesias to make my R code available upon publication

This project includes code to :
- input, read/clean and calculate metrics from processed acoustics data (Read clean.Rmd)
- conduct a spatial autocorrelation analysis
- compare acoustic backscatter and center of mass depth between years
- extract CTD and satellite oceanographic data
- build a generalized additive model to explore the effect of ocean conditions on center of mass depth
